Online Auction House

The online auction house auctions 3 types of items:
Celebrity items
Artifacts
Oil paintings

Registered users can make a big for an item while it is available. The countdown timer next to the details of each item indicates the availability.
When the timer reaches zero, bids are locked.

Once the auction shuts, if there is no other bud on the item greater than the users, the user can check out the item by filling a checkout form with the address and payment details.

FrontEnd: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
Backend: Python django framework
